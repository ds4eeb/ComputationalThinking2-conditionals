# Overview

Welcome! This is the second "computational thinking" lesson, which is about conditional statements and getting help finding bugs in your R code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will submit one output for this activity:

1.  A **PDF** of a rendered Quarto document with all of your R code. Please create a new Quarto document (e.g. don't use this `README.qmd`), include all of the code that appears in this document, in addition to adding your own code and **answers to all of the questions** in the "Q#" sections. Submit this through Gradescope.

*If you have trouble submitting as a PDF, please ask Calvin or Malin for help. If we still can't solve it, you can submit the .qmd file instead.*

A reminder: **Please label the code** in your final submission in two ways: 1) denote your answers to each question using headers that correspond to the question you're answering and 2) thoroughly "comment" your code: remember, this means annotating your code directly by typing descriptions of what each line does after a `#`. This will help future you!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's start by reading in the relevant packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

# 1. Conditionals

We've already worked with conditionals during one of the seaside chats, which used `case_when()`, `dplyr's` version of an `if_else` statement. Today we'll walk through using `if_else` statements, the precursor to `case_when()`, as well as get more practice with `case_when()`.

## 1.1 if else statements

`if else` statments take the form of:

``` default
if (condition is true){
  do something
} else {
  do something else
}
```

---------

## 1.2 `case_when()`

# 2. Getting help in R

Early in your R journey you will likely have errors in your R code more often than not, so knowing how to deal with code that doesn't work as you expect is a key part of learning. You have already been asked in past lessons to deal with this, by identifying error messages, accessing help pages, and going online to .

## 2.1 Help pages

## 2.2 Stack overflow

## 2.3 Traceback()?

## 2.4 LLMs
